                    Ltd (“Qure Skincare Pty Ltd”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to
                    these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its
                    features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile
                    Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such
                    changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.</span></p>
            <p><span>By consenting to Qure Skincare Pty Ltd’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring
                    SMS/text messages from and on behalf of Qure Skincare Pty Ltd through your wireless provider to the
                    mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not
                    Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other
                    technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order
                    updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other
                    marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).</span></p>
            <p><span>You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and
                    your consent is not a condition of any purchase with Qure Skincare Pty Ltd. Your participation in
                    this program is completely voluntary.</span></p>
            <p><span>We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with
