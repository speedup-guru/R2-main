                            Policy</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>prior to making a purchase. We want you to be completely
                        satisfied with your online purchase.</p>
                    <p>In taking up the subscription of one or more of our products, you have agreed to the following
                        terms and conditions:</p>
                    <p>Opt for the subscription payment choice available on the product page. The specified delivery
                        frequency is indicated on the same page. Your subscription starts as soon as your initial
                        payment is processed.</p>
                    <p>We will automatically debit the order amount on the same day of the month until cancelled by you
                        and your order will be processed and sent out within the next 2 business days after each payment
                        has been received.</p>
                    <p>Product Subscription items will ship automatically until you cancel. By placing a subscription
                        order, you are authorizing us to charge your card for future orders at the frequency and
                        quantity you selected. The actual cost of each shipment may vary depending on the quantity and
                        frequency chosen.</p>
                    <p>If your credit or debit card cannot be charged for any reason, we will attempt to charge your
                        account two more times. Should this fail as well, you will not receive the product for that
                        subscription period. You have the option to manage your subscription (such as changing your
                        payment method, updating shipping information, cancelling, suspending, or skipping a delivery)
                        by signing into your account with the email address associated with your subscription.</p>
                    <p>Cancellations after this time frame will still be billed for the subsequent period and the
                        subscription item will be sent.</p>
